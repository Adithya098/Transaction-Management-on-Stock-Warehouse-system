This is the course project for CS5424 (Distributed Database) @ NUS.
The learning tasks in this project involve the following: 
1. How to install a distributed database system on a cluster of machines
2. How to design a data model and implement transactions to support an application by taking into consideration of the workload of the application and the features of the database system
3. How to benchmark the performance of an application on NOSQL and SQL Databases.
The NOSQL Database we used is Cassandra and SQL Databased used was Citus.


You can find the implementations of Cassandra and Citus in their respective folders.
 
To understand the project in-depth, go through the "DD Project Report - Team B" pdf.
  
It has a detailed description of the data models with justifications for the design decisions, transaction scripts, details of the database's configuration, test scripts and benchmark results.
